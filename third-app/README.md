# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# what is state in react?

    - A state is built-in object in react that holds the component date.
    - A component state can change over a period of time; but whenver your either state or props is getting changed
    then component must re-render.
    - To manage a state in FBC(functional base component) we utilise the power of useState() hook.
